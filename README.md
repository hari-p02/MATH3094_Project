## Principal Component Analysis of CT Town Data
---

For this project, a PCA was performed on a dataset describing towns in the state of Connecticut. Features include demographic information such as median age and racial makeup, as well as financial, healthcare, and education information, such as median home value, median income, % with private/public healthcare, private vs public schooling, and more.
\\
The goal of this project is to identify correlation between different aspects of towns in Connecticut, and create a meaningful analysis of how towns in CT are distributed with respect to different import social topics. Questions that are attempted to be answered include: 
 - Do towns with high income tend to have a specific demographic makeup? 
 - Is there a relationship between the makeup of a town and the healthcare coverage of it? 
 - Do towns with lower income tend to have more crime?
